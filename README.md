# Basic ALU Design - Verilog

## Project Title
**4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog**

## Description
This project implements a simple 4-bit ALU capable of performing basic arithmetic and logic operations using Verilog HDL. It includes a testbench for simulation and verification.

## Features
The ALU supports the following operations based on a 3-bit select line:
| SEL Code | Operation     |
|----------|---------------|
| 000      | Addition (A + B) |
| 001      | Subtraction (A - B) |
| 010      | AND (A & B)       |
| 011      | OR (A \| B)        |
| 100      | NOT (~A)         |
